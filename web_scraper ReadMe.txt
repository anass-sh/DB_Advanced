create a function called scraper()
using beautiful soup i find all the classes that contain the hash, the time, 
and the amount of btc and usd because the have the same class.
create lists where to store the data we pull from the website 
and using for loops i append the data to the lists
i used the DataFrame to make it easy to sort the data by amount BTC and the using 
of ascending=False the data data is sorted from the highest amount to the lowest
and just by using function head(10) we get the highest 10 values
whith the while loop the function scraper starts every 60 sceonds
